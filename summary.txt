Name(s) and NetID(s) of group members: Harshvardhan Maskara (hm475) & Saksham Sood (ss3296)

Time spent on the assignment, in hours: 15

Implementation strategy: We worked on each problem together while taking turns at typing. To implement seek and scram we used 
our intuition to visualise the problem, assisted by the Ed posts.
    (describe how you went about implementing the assignment and how the work was divided between the partners.)

Testing strategy: Designed test cases based on advice on Ed for Dijkstra's algorithm (e.g. cyclic case).
    (how did you perform testing and design test cases to achieve coverage?)

Known problems: None
    (are there any things that do not work?)

Comments on the assignment: Extremeley stimulating and interesting.
